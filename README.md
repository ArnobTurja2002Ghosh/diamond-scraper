# About
DiamondScraper is a simple Python web scraper for [BrilliantEarth.com](https://www.brilliantearth.com). It scrapes data for both its natural and lab created diamond selection and writes it to a CSV file.  

## Inspiration
Buying a diamond can be frustrating and expensive.

I built DiamondScraper to create a dataset of natural and lab-created diamonds to demystify the value of the 4 Cs â€“ cut, color, clarity, carat.

## Requirements
- Firefox browser & [geckodriver](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers)
- pip install `gazpacho=1.1`
- conda install `pandas=1.1.3`
- conda install `selenium=3.141.0`

## Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Move to the `DiamondScraper` directory
3. Run `scraper.py`

There is also a script `processing.py` to cast categorical data types for a DataFrame.
